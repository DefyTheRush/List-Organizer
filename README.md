# ListOrganizer
A item organizer written in C#

Features:
- Adding and Removing entries
- See all entries in a simple window if you have too many
- See any entries if they are too long with ease with added scrolling up/down and left/right (if needed)
- Generous limits to entry length and checks for input
- System Locking and Unlocking (Buttons and List also behave correctly)
- Credits and Clarification in 'Info'
- See the total number of entries just in case you lose track
- Search for entries easily!
- Added a 'Testing Mode' feature to see all the features of the program (added prevention checks)

Notes: 
- This program is still in the works, so suggestions are welcome :)
- Please do not try to steal this, modify, and/or re-distribute this program

Usage:
- Load up the program and play around with all the buttons and features

Current Plans:
- Implementing a 'Update Items' feature to the ListBox (Bug: Removing a entry not last messes up the numbering of the items)
- Adding a Database (MySQL) to save values and modify
- Improving searching and organizing further
- Making a more user-friendly gui with less buttons up-front
